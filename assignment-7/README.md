#### Divs, Classes, Ids, and Spans

Divs are a structural element used to for clarifying areas of code. They create
a separating block around the objects with in it. Spans are also structural
elements like divs but they exist within a paragraph to emphasize words or
phrases. Classes are attributes that group areas of code together based on
similarities for easy CSS styling. Ids are unique words/phrases used as
identification of specific areas of code on a page. They are also used to jump
to a specific area on a page.

#### Alt Text

Alt text is a text description of an image. It is used by screen readers to
describe images to the hearing impaired. Alt text is important should be a
detailed and specific phrase for this reason.

#### Work Cycle

For this work cycle I made a page including media from Jidenna's *Bambi*. After
learning about new attributes, structural elements, and embedding. I put my new
knowledge to work in building this page. It took me a moment to remember what
the JPEG image was for in the multisource video code. I reread the website and
remembered the function of the poster image. Otherwise, I had no difficulty with
the remainder of the code. Putting thing into divs and using classes was fairly
simple, and I am exited to put these to use in my own style sheet when the
time comes.

I was surprised to see what the code looked like when I viewed the HTML live.
After looking at black and white pages all semester, it was a refreshing change.
I experimented with some other colors for fun but kept the originals, because
they matched the colors of everything else on the page. For the lyric paragraph, I
chose to emphasize the background vocals.
