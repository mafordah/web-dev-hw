        ... <em>(Ah ah ah ha)</em> <br />
        <em>(Hmm hmm hmm hmm)</em> <br />
        Bambi Bambi <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        My dear, my dear, my dear <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        My dear I want you here <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        But don't get too near for there's lions beware <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        Oh Bambi I won't lie <br />
        If I weren't in this spider web of mine <br />
        If grandfather never had seven wives <br />
        Then darling you would be love of my life <br />
        Oh Bambi it's my design <br />
        To run the jungle I must be a lion <br />
        Or be a cheetah but neither is fine <br />
        Don't wanna hurt my dear love of my life <br />
        Bambi Bambi <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        My dear, my dear, my dear <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        My dear I want you here <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        But don't get too near for there's lions beware <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        Sometimes I hide <br />
        When you FaceTime I text you back a lie <br />
        ‘Cause I'm afraid to look back in your eyes <br />
        I'm terrified you were love of my life <br />
        The women among the tribe <br />
        They will be jealous of this lullaby <br />
        I'll drink alone in my hotel and cry <br />
        ‘Cause now they know you are love of my life <br />
        Bambi Bambi <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        My dear, my dear, my dear <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        My dear I want you here <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        But don't get too near for there's lions beware <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        I wish that we were forever young <br />
        I always knew that this day would come <br />
        The fork in the road where I cannot run <br />
        Between loving many and loving one <br />
        I got the wedding invitation Bambi <br />
        I'm happy that he wants to make a family <br />
        But I cannot promise I won't run up in the church there screamin' your name Bambi <br />
        No one can take you from me Bambi <br />
        No one can take you from me Bambi <br />
        No one can take you from me Bambi <br />
        Bambi Bambi <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        My dear, my dear, my dear <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        My dear I want you here <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        But don't get too near for there's lions beware <em>(Ahh Bam-Bambi)</em> <br />
        I just wanna see my baby, that's my Bambi, that's my dear <br />
        I just wanna see my baby, that's my Bambi, that's my dear <br />
        I just wanna see my baby, that's my Bambi, that's my dear <br />
        I just wanna see my baby, that's my Bambi, that's my dear <br />
