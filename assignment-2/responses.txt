Briefly describe one way how data travels on the internet.

Data travels on the internet as single bits, 1s or 0s, over time.
This can be done through electricity, light, or radio waves. When
traveling by light, light runs through fiber optics cables (threads
of glass that reflect light) with the light on representing a 1
and off representing a 0. This is the fastest form of travel for
data on the internet as it can send multiple beams of light at
once, and it travels literally at the speed of light.
