# Assignment 2

## Miya Fordah

I am taking Intro to Web Design because I am a Media Arts major, and I am interested in developing websites without a drag-and-drop editor. I have designed websites before, but I have never fully coded one myself. It feels like an important skill to have as I enter this field. I am especially interested now because I have recently been asked to edit and create two websites for two different small businesses. If I have a basic understanding of the code going into the editors I'm using, I hope to do a better job of customizing the websites to their needs.

#### Things I Hope to learn
- How to create a professional looking website from scratch
- How to ensure a website is secure
- How to animate parts of webpage, specifically scroll effects
