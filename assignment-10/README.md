#### Design Process

For this project I choose "Playfair" and "Love Ya Like A Sister" as they are both relatively fun fonts. I wanted the fonts to reflect the fun nature of excerpt. Though I do think that a san-serif font for my headings my have complemented "Playfair" better, but I really liked the drawn style look of "Love Ya Like A Sister".

#### System Fonts, Web Fonts, and Web-safe Fonts

System fonts are font types preinstalled on every computer. Web fonts are more versatile fonts that can be found on the web and installed or embedded into a webpage. Web-safe fonts are fonts that are considered save for web because they are installed on just about every computer so there is a much less chance of the font not displaying.

#### Work Cycle

This work cycle, I chose to do a webpage for "Return to the Hundred Acre Wood" by David Benedictus. I chose this excerpt as it was easy to find online and it had a section of separated out text that I though would be fun to style. I made the background yellow, because working with Winnie the Pooh, that was the first color that came to mind. I then added a blue div surrounding white divs, because blu complements yellow well. Then I chose the fonts for the reasons outlined above. I did some styling with text alignment and pseudo elements to achieve a look I liked. I also added a horizontal rule and some dots to separate out the text to add structure. The last thing I added was the link to more information which changes color with hover.
