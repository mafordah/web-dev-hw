#### Universal, Element, Class, and Id Selector Types

The universal selector is used to select and change everything on the page. The element selector is used to select and change everything of one type such as:

- h1, h2 etc.
- p
- div
- nav

Class selectors style a specific class and are used style different elements together without styling everything, or to style some of a type of element. Id selectors are used to style an element buy calling forth it's unique id. It is best used to style one element.

#### Color Palette

The colors I chose were "peachPuff", yellow (#faec94), and light blue (#d0edf0). I also added "salmon" to the text as it matched well with the provided media I used. I chose these colors with the help of a google search of 50s colors and some mixing and matching of them. I also took some inspiration from the musical "Hairspray" as I had watched it recently. Though I know it was based in the 60s, it seemed on the cusp of the 50s enough take into consideration. It seemed as though most of the 50s colors where pale and muted, something like Easter colors.

#### Work Cycle

For my work cycle, I was unsuccessful at finding very useable graphics on my own so I chose to use the graphics provided. Once I looked them over, I knew immediately that I wanted to put the text on the blob image. After some quick googling, I figured it out. I wasn't, however, able to get the uppermost div out from under it. I used the star graphic as my second image, flipped, copied, and changed the opacity so that there would be two of them and they would blend into the background. I wanted it to look like one background image. My overall concept was something like that of an old pattern on a chair. Just for fun, I added some 50s lingo through some more googling.
