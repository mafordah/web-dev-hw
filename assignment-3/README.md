#### How Browsers Function

Browsers take in HTML and CSS into a rendering engine that interprets the data and turns it
into visable content in the user interface. The browser engine directs action to and from the rendering
engine, the user interface, and servers. To get this information, the browser must be
directed to it from the network. Any interactive functions are interpreted from Java Script.
I currently use Google Chrome. Though I did use Microsoft Edge to view images from a p5.js 
file while I was in Creative Coding.

#### Markup Language

A markup language is the text language used to build primarily text related content on to a 
web page. HTML is the most common markup language. It is standardized, but it has frequent
version changes and not all HTML sites open the same on every browser.
