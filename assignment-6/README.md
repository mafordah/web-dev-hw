#### Forms and Their Purposes

The most common form I've come across is the login form used to get into any
account you might have with any website. Between school, work, and personal
accounts, we've all seen plenty of login forms. The purpose of this form is to
identify the person accessing a site and give them access to their personalized
information. It is primary a security measure.

Another common form is a checkout form. This is the form we see right before we
make a questionable purchase decision in which we put our personal information.
This form is (usually) a secure way to share credit card information so that we
can make online purchases without risking our entire savings.

#### Input Examples

- Username - Text: Part of the authentication used to access certain websites, especially social media.
- Date - Selection: While dates are sometimes text inputs, they are also often
selection inputs with the month, date, and year as options. They are used to
input date of birth (registration forms), date of arrival (hotel purchases),
credit card expiration date (online purchase) etc.
- Upload - Button: This type of button input is commonly found on job application
forms that require you to upload a resume. They are also found all over the UM
Moodle to submit certain assignments.

#### Work Cycle

This work cycle, I created a 'rate your experience' form for Sushi Hana downtown.
After reading the website and the book, I started filling in the parts of the code
we learned last week (meta data, addresses, emails etc.) From there, I put together
a table for their lunch and dinner hours. I added the style to the head of the
code and added a 0.5px solid grey border with 3px padding. I went with grey instead
of black, because I wanted the border to have some separation from the text.

Then I started on the form. I added two text inputs. One for the date with a max
length and size 8 and a placeholder text. The other for the server's name with
no extra attributes. Then I added a radio input for the satisfaction of the
dining experience with the middle option prechecked. Then I added a comments
section with 70 columns, 8 rows, a max length of 500, and placeholder text
stating the max limit. I chose this size because it landed at about halfway to
the table.

Finally, I went into illustrator and built and 100px by 20px submit button to
put on the bottom of the form.
