#### Head and Body Elements

Each HTML page can only have one head and one body element.

The head element contains data about the webpage for the browser to process
such as the website's title, description, and author. It also includes other
meta data such as what characters the website uses (charset) and it's viewport
(width and scale).

The body element contains the data that shows up directly on the webpage. This
includes any text, links, images, etc. It also includes the structure of the text.

#### Structural vs Semantic Markup

Structural markup includes guiding visual information such as paragraphs, headings,
breaks, and lists. All of these elements denote the structure of a webpage.

Semantic markup is used to emphasize words or phrases through the use of bolds,
italics, quotations, citations, definitions etc. All of these elements are used
to change or highlight the meaning of a document's text.

#### Work Cycle

This cycle, I further familiarized my self with HTML as a markup language. I
began with adding the four main document elements: doctype, HTML, head, and body.
From there, I added the language and country code attribute to the HTML element.
I then added the different types of meta data we addressed this week to the <head>. I was a
little confused about whether or not the elements that go inside the <head> and
<body> are considered head and body elements. I answered the
README question assuming that wasn't the case, but I wasn't sure.

I decided to make this week's webpage on a cream puff recipe, because I've been
trying to get my boyfriend to make them for me since I found out he knew how. I
added the headings to the <body> with the recipe title in heading 1, the ingredients
and directions in heading 2, and the contact me in heading 4. I chose to make
the contact me section smaller and separated by a horizontal rule because that
information felt separate from the recipe itself. I also chose to include outside
links to the recipe and the image. For my semantics, I used 'strong' on the time
and temperature, because that seemed to be important information, and I used
'emphasize' for the Celsius temperature and the information on the texture of
the cream puffs, because both phrases felt like aside information.

After this, I double checked some links as I've gotten the image link wrong the
first time for every single assignment so far. I hope my email link works,
because I wasn't able to get anything to pop up for myself.
