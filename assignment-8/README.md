#### HTML

Learning HTML was really fun. It tied together a lot of things I learned in p5.js. We used HTML back then
but only enough meta elements to run p5. If I had know as much as I do now, I could have done so much more.
I was new to me but I didn't find it difficult. Since it's such an evolving code, there is so much to learn
on the internet so I was never out of answers for my questions.

#### CSS

I'm really excited to learn some web styling techniques. I was recently given control of my company website
for my part time job. Although most of it is drag and drop, I find myself lost when it come to adding and
changing certain aspects that can only be done in CSS. I am especially curious about using CSS to style photos and slideshows.

#### Work Cycle

For this assignment I chose to do an instructable on drawing I brontosaurus. I discussed why I chose this in the site so I won't dwell on it for too long. I chose a pink background for the page as it matched well with my green drawings. I could have used color codes, but I was curious about all of the color names HTML accepts. It's a lot more than p5.js, that's for sure. I wasn't expecting over 140 names. I picked a pink that I like and went with that. After drawing everything, I styled everything with white divs and image backgrounds with grey text. I felt the grey was softer than straight black. Other than writing instructions and figuring out how to write alt text for such weird images, I didn't have a lot of difficulties. Really, the hardest part was coming up with content to but in it. I was very lost on where to put a table for the longest time, and how to fit in some type of iframe. I was happy there's a webpage option for iframes, or I would've had a hard time adding in music or a video that fit in. I did enjoy putting together all of the HTML elements into one site, though. It was definitely fulfilling.
