#### Client

My client is a realtor company for beach homes called Beachside Realtor Company LLC. They offer the buying and selling of homes through a realtor service. Their colors are blue and yellow. They need their site to look nautical and oceanic yet clean and contemporary.

#### Display: block, Display: inline, and Display: inline-block

Display: block turns inline items into block items so that the item moves everything below and it sits on it's own line. This is often used for vertical menus. Display: inline-block takes the item off its own line. Items then must take up the full space the container its in and respect the margins and spacing. Display: inline also forces items off their own lines, but instead allows the objects to flow without respecting the margins and spacing.

#### Work Cycle

For this assignment, I started with the realtor concept after putting HGTV's House Hunters on in the background. I went with a navy blue and white theme with yellow accents, so the website felt somewhat ocean/beach related. I styled the nav bar to begin with and eventually settled on having the title above and to the left of it. The div of body text is positioned absolute so that it can be slightly over the images for stylistic reasons. I wanted the photos to blend in with the rest of the site and the overlap helps to bring it together. The photos I got were conveniently the same aspect ratio so I only had to size the width. Then I added the dropdown. Something I did with styling wouldn't allow me to pad the left side of the links without moving them out of the navigation background, so there isn't any padding on the left when you hover. However, I don't totally hate the way it looks. Lastly, I added a footer just so it looked like a completed website. I also had some issues here with positioning as the margin leaves some space at the end of the window.

In reality the pages probably wouldn't be as identical as I made them, but I'm happy with how it turned out.
