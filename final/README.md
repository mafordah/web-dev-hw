#### Web Development

Though I became familiar with GitHub, version control, and repositories in creative coding last semester, I feel like I increased my understanding of the platform in its use for the new languages I learned this semester. Its organization is intuitive and easy to use. It always feels good to know that I'm learning an industry standard program now rather than later.

#### Web Design

As far as web design, I learned far more about what I can do with code. Specifically, I learned way more about fonts and media integration. In my previous coding experience, the use of fonts and media were optional. Though I did use music in some projects, it was very helpful to learn these things first hand. Though google is a helpful tool, having organized information right in a website for me to go through every week is far easier.

I was so excited to learn about web based fonts. There's an infinite number of fonts out there, and with font selection being probably my favorite part of design work, knowing web based integration has made the web design process so much more fun for me.

#### Work Cycle

For this work cycle, I chose to do a small portfolio website. Though it's not at all comprehensive, it features some of my most recent work. The text, with some edits, is near directly from my print portfolio. I tried to stay in line with that thematically to give my self some kind of guidelines with colors and fonts.

I used a structure similar to my CSS website but changed the header photos by going with circles. This was a choice I made as I used circle photos in my print portfolio. I also added a strike-through design on the nav bar to indicate what page you're on.

I had some issues with spacing that created a lot of extra space on the right side if the window is resized. I couldn't figure out what in the code was causing it. I also noticed that the dropdown, though in the correct place in Chrome, was too high when I opened it in Internet Explorer. I couldn't find a way to change the spacing without negatively impacting one or the other.

I definitely had to go back and look up aspects of web design and development that I'd forgotten. Specifically, self-hosted videos and how to link them with posters. Other than that, I had very few hiccups in creating this website.
