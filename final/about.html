      <h3> ABOUT </h3>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Missoula, Montana. I first expressed an interest in graphic design during the eighth grade when my two options for classes were Computer Applications or Spanish. We were asked to create pseudo-companies and brand them in Microsoft Publisher. I fell in love. As soon as I started high school, I enrolled in the school’s graphic design program. I also took on 3D design and animation. After moving from Microsoft programs to Adobe programs and everything in between, I’ve learned innumerable skills in my field. I graduated high school with four certifications as an Adobe Certified Associate: Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and InDesign. With these certifications, I’ve been given the opportunity to work with my community on graphic design projects like t-shirts, logos, and business plans. On my own time, I continue honing my traditional art skills through drawing and other media. I’m always excited to start new projects and make the aspirations of others a reality.
