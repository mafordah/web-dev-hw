#### The Way Back Machine

For my journey through The Way Back Machine, I looked at Missoula Federal Credit
Union's website back in 2005, at least decade before I'd have an account there.
As I soon won't be able to do my banking online as they renovate the website, I
wanted to look at what it was all those years ago. I can't imagine going to that
site as it was and thinking 'yeah, I'll put my sensitive bank account information
here'. The site was mostly beige and forest green with maroon headings. It doesn't
look like what I would recognize today as a secure website at all. The only
thing that is similar is the graphic in the logo. Today the website has much brighter
coloring with modern fonts, buttons, and hyperlinks.

#### The GIT Module

I started using the GIT module last semester so it is great to be back into it.
I haven't had any problems applying GIT to this course, and I was hoping this
class would also be using it when I enrolled. Because I already had everything
downloaded on this computer, it was quick and easy to connect to the new repo
and upload code.
